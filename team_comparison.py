#How it works:
#Allows users to select two teams.
#Fetches head-to-head match history between the selected teams.
#Displays the match history in a table.
#Fetches seasonal performance data for both teams.
#Displays the performance metrics in a formatted way.
#Handles cases where no data is available.
